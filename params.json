Thus, you can\r\nuse data files written as ASCII data as well as .xtc-trajectories.\r\n\r\nFor bug-reports, write to\r\n\r\n   sittel@lettis.net\r\nor\r\n   florian.sittel@physik.uni-freiburg.de\r\n\r\nHappy Computing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compilation #\r\n\r\nCreate a build-directory in the project root and change into\r\nthat directory:\r\n\r\n # mkdir build\r\n \r\n # cd build\r\n\r\nRun cmake, based on the underlying project:\r\n\r\n # cmake ..\r\n\r\nHopefully, everything went right.\r\nIf not, carefully read the error messages.\r\nTypical errors are missing dependencies...\r\n\r\nIf everything is o.k., run make (on multicore machines, use '-j' to parallelize\r\ncompilation, e.g. 'make -j 4' for up to four parallel jobs):\r\n\r\n # make\r\n\r\nNow, you should find the 'fastca' binary in the 'src' folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n  * LAPACK\r\n  * Boost (program_options), min. version 1.49\r\n  * cmake, min. version 2.8\r\n  * g++\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
